# react-starter
React starter kit, powered with Webpack and Babel.
This is mostly Webpack configuration for React project that includes transpiling using Babel.

These configurations are chucked from the (excellent) book [Progressive Web Apps with React](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/progressive-web-apps-react) by Scott Domes which has a good explanation on how Webpack works inside a React project. 

I think this is a good starting point for a React project, so I can start code React rightaway, without having to dabble much with tools configurations.

# Usage
1. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
2. During development, use `npm start` to start a local dev server that also includes hot reloading
3. On production, use `npm run build` to create bundles of scripts and also minify CSS and HTML. The results are stored in `build/` folder
